## Introduction

Welcome to my repository showcasing Power BI dashboards that have driven significant growth for my Amazon seller clients by analyzing and visualizing key performance metrics, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize their selling strategies.

### Features

The dashboards offer powerful features to help manage and optimize Amazon seller performance. Sales Analytics allows you to visualize sales trends, revenue, and profit margins for each client, providing clear insights into their sales performance. Advertising Performance enables you to analyze ad spend, Advertising Cost of Sales (ACoS), and Return on Investment (ROI), helping to assess and enhance advertising efficiency.
